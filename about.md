Hello Everyone! My name is David Liu and I am a Computer Science major from the rural outskirts of Northern Virginia. This Fall, I'll be entering my junior year at Princeton University. 

Thus far, my academic experience in college has been less of a plan, than a journey. Coming from a strongly STEM focused high school, I entered college as a chemical engineer, combining my interest in both chemistry and numbers. But I quicky shifted paths when I discovered the inclusivity of the computer science program. I loved that the major opened its arms to students of all backgrounds and promoted strong interest at an early stage.

Since switching majors, I have also begun pursuing a certificate in Statistics and Machine Learning while exploring courses in neuroscience, African American studies and music. 

My two technical internships in NYC these past two summers have equipped me with skills in data mining, analysis and visualization along with a growing interest in machine learning algorithms.
