## Technical Side Projects 

### HookCup
A summer-long hackathon project created at HookLogic, HookCup increases office cohesion by connecting groups of colleagues who might not have met each other. In a large, busy work environment, the slack bot gathers people from a wide variety of backgrounds (sales, marketing, software) and sends them on sponsored coffee breaks. The break gives colleagues a simple, convenient opportunity to meet individuals with a different perspective of the company. 

During a two week pilot of the program at HookLogic, the slack bot sponsored over 100 coffee runs. Two thirds of the 80-person office registered for the program. Moreoever, The pilot's participants spanned every department in the office, achieving the ultimate goal of connecting diverse colleagues.  

### Book Up

Book Up monitors the Textbook Exchange group at Princeton and sends the student an email when a needed book is listed for sale, providing faster, cheaper and more convenient textbook purchases.

The application has been made available to over 3,300 undergraduates in the Princeton community and completed two semesters of successful operation. 

*Source code for Book Up is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dliu18/BookUp)*

### Air Battle 

One of my first projects, I built Air Battle, a first person shooter game, over a summer in high school. The game was the culmination of a summer of Java and introduced me to the principles of game design.

## Daily Princetonian Writing 
Writing for and leading the sports section of the Daily Princetonian has been one of my least anticipated yet memorable extracurriculars through college. What started as a simple means of extending a personal hobby has expanded into my most significant leadership opportunity. Directing and managing a staff of nearly a dozen writers, I ensure the daily publication of all things related to Princeton athletics. A short sample of my favorite articles follows. The complete list can be found on the Daily Princetonian [website](http://dailyprincetonian.com/author/dml3/)
